## Usage

### Fields

Log encourages careful, structured logging through logging fields instead of
long, unparseable error messages. For example, instead of: `log.Fatalf("Failed
to send event %s to topic %s with key %d")`, you should log the much more
discoverable:

```go
log.WithFields(log.Fields{
  "event": event,
  "topic": topic,
  "key": key,
}).Fatal("Failed to send event")
```

We've found this API forces you to think about logging in a way that produces
much more useful logging messages. We've been in countless situations where just
a single added field to a log statement that was already there would've saved us
hours. The `WithFields` call is optional.

In general, with Log using any of the `printf`-family functions should be
seen as a hint you should add a field, however, you can still use the
`printf`-family functions with Log.

### Default Fields

Often it's helpful to have fields _always_ attached to log statements in an
application or parts of one. For example, you may want to always log the
`request_id` and `user_ip` in the context of a request. Instead of writing
`log.WithFields(log.Fields{"request_id": request_id, "user_ip": user_ip})` on
every line, you can create a `log.Entry` to pass around instead:

```go
requestLogger := log.WithFields(log.Fields{"request_id": request_id, "user_ip": user_ip})
requestLogger.Info("something happened on that request") # will log request_id and user_ip
requestLogger.Warn("something not great happened")
```

### Level logging
seven logging levels: Trace, Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Fatal and Panic.

```go
log.Trace("Something very low level.")
log.Debug("Useful debugging information.")
log.Info("Something noteworthy happened!")
log.Warn("You should probably take a look at this.")
log.Error("Something failed but I'm not quitting.")
// Calls os.Exit(1) after logging
log.Fatal("Bye.")
// Calls panic() after logging
log.Panic("I'm bailing.")
```

You can set the logging level on a `Logger`, then it will only log entries with
that severity or anything above it:

```go
// Will log anything that is info or above (warn, error, fatal, panic). Default.
log.SetLevel(log.InfoLevel)
```

It may be useful to set `log.Level = log.DebugLevel` in a debug or verbose
environment if your application has that.

### Entries

Besides the fields added with `WithField` or `WithFields` some fields are
automatically added to all logging events:

1. `time`. The timestamp when the entry was created.
2. `msg`. The logging message passed to `{Info,Warn,Error,Fatal,Panic}` after
   the `AddFields` call. E.g. `Failed to send event.`
3. `level`. The logging level. E.g. `info`.

### Formatters

The built-in logging formatters are:

* `log.TextFormatter`. Logs the event in colors if stdout is a tty, otherwise
* `log.JSONFormatter`. Logs fields as JSON.
